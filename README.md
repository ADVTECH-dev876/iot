# 🔌 IoT Signaling App (Java)

A **Java-based IoT signaling console application** that allows remote access and control of smart devices such as **fan, solar unit, and IoT lights**.  
This project demonstrates how IoT devices can be **switched ON/OFF** via software commands, simulating remote access functionality.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Fan Control** – Turn fan ON/OFF remotely  
- **Solar Remote Control** – Manage solar device state  
- **IoT Light Control** – Switch light ON/OFF  
- **Menu-driven console interface**  
- **Extensible** – New IoT devices can be added easily  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java (Core Java, Console-based UI)  
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Simulation:** Console app simulates IoT signaling without real hardware  
- **Optional:** Can be extended with MQTT / REST APIs for real IoT devices

## 📖 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iot-signaling-app.git
   cd iot-signaling-app
````

2. Compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen menu to control devices:

   ```
   1. Turn ON Fan
   2. Turn OFF Fan
   3. Turn ON Light
   4. Turn OFF Light
   5. Activate Solar Remote
   6. Exit
   ```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* Understand **Java OOP concepts** (classes, interfaces, abstraction)
* Learn how **IoT device control** can be simulated in software
* Practice building **menu-driven console apps**
* Prepare code that can be extended to **real IoT communication protocols**

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Add **MQTT/HTTP protocol** support for real IoT hardware
* Develop a **GUI (JavaFX / Swing)** for better user experience
* Add more devices (AC, smart plugs, sensors)
* Enable **voice command integration**

👉 Do you also want me to **write the Java code skeleton** for this IoT app (with classes for Fan, SolarRemote, Light, and a menu in Main.java), or just keep the README?
